DiscordHook is a simple global keyboard hook that redirects keyboard inputs to discord.

Control and Alt inputs are redirected but not blocked on the foreground window.

You can activate/desactivate the hook with a macro.
The current macro is CTRL+ALT+d but in future release you'll be able to customize that.
