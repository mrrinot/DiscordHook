DiscordHook is a simple global keyboard hook that redirects keyboard inputs to discord.

Control and Alt inputs are redirected but not blocked from the foreground window (meaning they still affect the foreground process)

You can activate/desactivate the hook with a macro.

The current macro is (CTRL+ALT+d) but in future release you'll be able to customize that.
